This is a very incomplete list of incomplete tasks for abiftool
* Code hygiene
** Testing (test)
   - [ ] fixme
** Build & Packaging (build)
   - [ ] Make more "pythonic" (whatever that means)
** Refactoring (refactor)
   - [ ] Clean up Python imports
* For 0.34.0 - BLOCKED
  - [X] **CRITICAL: Fix STL election discovery in awt**
  - [ ] Add disclaimer about ranked ballots from approval elections are estimates
  - [ ] **AWT: "See transformed ballots" accordion UI**
        When transform_ballots is enabled for ANY method (not just IRV/Pairwise),
        add accordion link that reveals transformed ABIF inline on results page.
        Applies to all voting methods where ballot transformation occurs:
        IRV, Pairwise/Condorcet, STAR, etc. See ballot-conversion-claude.md for
        complete implementation guidance.
  - [ ] Review [[https://github.com/electorama/abiftool/issues][bug list]]
  - [ ] See [[../CHANGELOG.org]]
* Post 0.34.0
  - [ ] Create bifhub and merge fetchmgr.py into it (see awt/docs/bifhub.md)
  - [ ] Add `source_url` metadata to all generated localabif outputs (provenance)
        Ensure every converter/fetch path that writes to `localabif/` sets
        `metadata.source_url` to the exact download URL used (e.g., `url` or
        first entry in `urls`). Apply to sfjson, sftxt, preflib, nycdems,
        debvote, nameq (including bolson-nameq data from Brian Olson's repo),
        and any others handled by fetchmgr or abiflib.
  - [ ] Set ballot_type/tally_method when converting real elections to ABIF
        e.g. sftxt_fmt.py, preflib_fmt.py, nycdem_fmt.py, debvote_fmt.py, etc.
  - [ ] Update fetchmgr.py to automatically set ballot_type metadata during import
  - Moar [[Code hygiene]] (see above)
